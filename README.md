Meme Art is too underrated. The exchange of viral content is overrun by centralized servers that keep the credits and revenues of artistics values mantaining without adecuate recognition to creators. The marketplace of memes of diferent extensions has become unfair since digital platforms becomes richer and publishers can not access to a considerable amount of money that represents the benefit they generate.

Users are daily commited to social media content that they contribute like curators and creators. The massive spread of memes have the same value that create it because one can not exist without another to be succesfull replicated in human consciousness. So few people can access to a stable salary because their viral content but so much people contribute to that output. 

We propose a random game of curators and publishers when both sides gain tokens depending of the viralization of their files, texts, images, sounds, videos, 3D objects.


1. Value Proposition

We propose the INTI as a currency of exchange in a secure, anonymous, opt-in content
system based in the browser and the mobile app webview.

The INTI system provides:

• Curators: improved currency revenues when spreading viral content.

• Inventors: improved currency revenues when creating viral content.

2. Introduction

One of the hopes on Internet is to create a tool with we can share information directed to improve humanity in various ways. The production of knowledge on Internet had giveaway a revolution without precedents, the creation of new bonds of freedom, a new worldwide community with new set of expressions replicated because that condition of true. Some content become viral because is recognized for a massive group of people and that replication is a fact that shows a confirmation of social culture and human relationships. The recopilation, aproppiation and manifestation of individual voices that can not have another place to flow their ideas, are one of the pilars of innovation and neccesary disruption to solve human problems. This sharing have the value that is censored in centralized servers that becomes bussiness models of greed. We need a bussiness model for social revolution. A new set of rules wich awards inventors and curators of data objects that can be priced properly by the near community.

This paper will review the current state of meme sharing and the predicament of content producers. It will outline a new solution that creates a transparent and efficient blockchain-based game for inventors and curators accurately valuing and rewarding the key driver of Internet viral content, a fair recognition.
